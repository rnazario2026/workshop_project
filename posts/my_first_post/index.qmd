## Fact or Myth? Does Age and Gender Really Affect Car Insurance Premium? (India)

![](/ca.jpg)

### **Introduction:**

Does one's age affect the amount they pay annually on their premium?

If so, does sex/gender also become a factor? And what is the difference between them?

### Prediction:

Yes, I believe that younger people have a higher premium than those who are older because of the assumption that younger drivers are more inexperienced. I also believe that gender doesn't make a difference in price.

### Approach:

We're going to use a data set created by [Apoorva Sharma](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/apoorvasharma03/vehicle-insurance-dataset?resource=download). This data set is set in India and captures anonymized records related to vehicle insurance customers, offering insights into demographics, vehicle details, insurance history, policy features, and claim outcomes.

-   **Source:** The exact source is unspecified, but the data resembles real-world insurance records commonly used for analysis and modeling.

-   **Collection Method:** Data was likely gathered from insurance application systems, policy records, and claims databases.

-   **Key Variables:** Includes customer age, gender, driving experience, vehicle age/type, prior insurance, premium amount, sales channel, regional info, and claim history.

-   **Size:** Contains approximately **400,000 rows**, with each row representing a customer or policy.

-   **Use Cases:** Ideal for EDA, feature engineering, predictive modeling (e.g., claim prediction), and customer segmentation in the insurance sector.

### Results:

```{r}
#| echo: false

# Suppress package startup messages for a cleaner output
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(ggplot2))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(DataEditR))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(dplyr))

# Read the data from the CSV file
Vehicle_Insurance <- read.csv("../../Vehicle_Insurance.csv")

# Create a new column for annual premium in USD and filter the data
Vehicle_Insurance <- Vehicle_Insurance |>
  mutate(
    annual_premium_usd = Annual_Premium * 0.011
  ) |>
  # Filter out any annual premiums that are over $2000
  filter(
    annual_premium_usd <= 2000
  )

# Group the data by age and gender and calculate the mean annual premium
Vehicle_Insurance_Aggregated <- Vehicle_Insurance |>
  group_by(Age, Gender) |>
  summarise(
    annual_premium_usd = mean(annual_premium_usd, na.rm = TRUE),
    .groups = 'drop'
  )

# Create the scatter plot with a linear model trend line
# The 'shape' aesthetic is now included inside aes() to create the legend
ggplot(data = Vehicle_Insurance_Aggregated, mapping = aes(x = Age, y = annual_premium_usd, color = Gender, shape = Gender)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("Male" = "cornflowerblue", "Female" = "pink")) +
  labs(
    title = "Age vs. Annual Premium (Average)",
    subtitle = "India",
    shape = "Gender",
    x = "Age (Years)",
    y = "Average Annual Premium (USD)"
  )
```

**Overview:** Annual premium increases as one's age increases.

#### Discussion:

My first assumption was not correct since the chart demonstrated that there is a linear increase as age increases but I found it interesting how during the ages between 20 and 45 there is also a linear decrease which means that there is a period in which one's age does affect how much their premium is but not in the way I first assumed.

For my second assumption, I was correct since there is not a major difference in premiums when it came to sex/gender. Which means that one's sex/gender does not dictate the price of one's insurance premium in India.
