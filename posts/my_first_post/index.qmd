## Fact or Myth? Does Age and Gender Really Affect Car Insurance Premium?

![](/ca.jpg)

### **Introduction:**

Does one's age affect the amount they pay annually on their premium?

If so, does gender also become a factor? And what is the difference between them?

### Prediction:

Yes, I believe that younger people have a higher premium than those who are older because of the assumption that younger drivers are more inexperienced. I also believe that gender doesn't make a difference in price.

### Approach:

We're going to use a data set created by Apoorva Sharma. This data set captures anonymized records related to vehicle insurance customers, offering insights into demographics, vehicle details, insurance history, policy features, and claim outcomes.

-   **Source:** The exact source is unspecified, but the data resembles real-world insurance records commonly used for analysis and modeling.

-   **Collection Method:** Data was likely gathered from insurance application systems, policy records, and claims databases.

-   **Key Variables:** Includes customer age, gender, driving experience, vehicle age/type, prior insurance, premium amount, sales channel, regional info, and claim history.

-   **Size:** Contains approximately **300,000 rows**, with each row representing a customer or policy.

-   **Use Cases:** Ideal for EDA, feature engineering, predictive modeling (e.g., claim prediction), and customer segmentation in the insurance sector.

Vehicle_Insurance <- read.csv("../../Vehicle_Insurance.csv")

Vehicle_Insurance <- Vehicle_Insurance |> mutate(
  annual_premium_usd = Annual_Premium * 0.011
)


ggplot(data=Vehicle_Insurance, mapping= aes(x=Age,y= annual_premium_usd, color= Gender))+ geom_point()+ geom_smooth(method="lm")
