## How Age and Gender Affect Car Insurance Premium.

![](/ca.jpg)

### **Introduction:**

Does one's age affect the amount they pay annually on their premium?

If so, does gender also become a factor? And what is the difference between them?

### Prediction: 

Yes, I believe that younger people have a higher premium than those who are older because of the assumption that younger drivers are more inexperienced. I also believe that gender doesn't make a difference in price.
