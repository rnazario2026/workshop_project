## Fact or Myth? Does Age and Gender Really Affect Vehicle Insurance Premium? (India)

![](/ca.jpg)

### **Introduction:**

Vehicle insurance is a smart financial decision that can protect you from the unexpected costs of an accident.

But does one's age affect the amount they pay annually on their premium?

If so, does sex/gender also become a factor? And what is the difference between them?

### Prediction:

Yes, I believe that younger people have a higher premium than those who are older because of the assumption that younger drivers are more inexperienced. I also believe that sex/gender doesn't make a difference in price.

### Approach:

We're going to use a data set created by [Apoorva Sharma](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/apoorvasharma03/vehicle-insurance-dataset?resource=download). This data set is set in India and captures anonymized records related to vehicle insurance customers, offering insights into demographics, vehicle details, insurance history, policy features, and claim outcomes.

-   **Source:** The exact source is unspecified, but the data resembles real-world insurance records that are commonly used for analysis and modeling.

-   **Collection Method:** Data was likely gathered from insurance application systems, policy records, and claims databases.

-   **Key Variables:** Includes customer age, sex/gender, driving experience, vehicle age/type, prior insurance, premium amount, sales channel, regional info, and claim history.

-   **Size:** Contains approximately **400,000 rows**, with each row representing a customer or policy.

### Results:

```{r}
#| echo: true

suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(ggplot2))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(DataEditR))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(dplyr))


Vehicle_Insurance <- read.csv("../../Vehicle_Insurance.csv")

Vehicle_Insurance <- Vehicle_Insurance |>
  mutate(
    annual_premium_usd = Annual_Premium * 0.011
  ) |>filter(annual_premium_usd <= 2000)


Vehicle_Insurance_Aggregated <- Vehicle_Insurance |>
  group_by(Age, Gender) |>
  summarise(
    annual_premium_usd = mean(annual_premium_usd, na.rm = TRUE),
    .groups = 'drop'
  )


ggplot(data = Vehicle_Insurance_Aggregated, mapping = aes(x = Age, y = annual_premium_usd, color =Gender, shape =Gender)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("Male" = "cornflowerblue", "Female" = "pink")) +
  labs(
    title = "Age vs. Annual Premium (Average)",
    subtitle = "India",
    shape = "Gender",
    x = "Age (Years)",
    y = "Average Annual Premium (USD)"
  )
```

```{r}

Vehicle_Insurance_Aggregated |>
  group_by(Gender) |>
  summarise(
    Avg_Premium = mean(annual_premium_usd))
```

**Overview:** Annual premium increases as one's age increases. Male and Female have a similar average as well only having a difference of 7 dollars.

### Discussion:

My first assumption was not correct since the chart demonstrated that there is a linear increase as age increases but I found it interesting how during the ages between 20 and 35 there is also a linear decrease which means that there is a period in which one's age does affect how much their premium is but not in the way I first assumed.

For my second assumption, I was also incorrect since the difference in premiums was 7 dollars. Which means that one's sex/gender could dictate the price of one's insurance premium in India.
